# Practical 2 

This assignment is focusing on a few key areas:
• Language detection – how to detect a language given a sentence. 
• Multilingual embeddings produced in an offline setting – how to align two semantic 
spaces representing two different languages.
• Transformer self-attention – what are the mathematical properties of transformer 
models? The intuition is essential to understand the mechanics of complex models. 
• Neural Machine Translation – understanding how a real-world model works.
